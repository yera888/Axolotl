        <h1>What is an axolotl?</h1>
        <p>
          An axolotl is a neotenic salamander. Instead of completing full
          metamorphosis like most salamanders do, axolotls remain fully aquatic
          and retain their feathery external gills, broad smile, and finned tail
          into adulthood. They’re native to the canals and wetlands of
          Xochimilco in Mexico City, where they once thrived but are now
          critically endangered in the wild due to habitat loss, pollution, and
          invasive species. Axolotls are famous for their extraordinary ability
          to regenerate. They can regrow limbs, spinal cord, parts of the heart
          and brain, and even sections of their jaws without scarring. In care,
          they prefer cool, clean, gently moving freshwater, low light, and a
          protein-rich diet liek earthworms. Adults typically reach 9–12 inches
          (23–30 cm). Their colors or morphs range from wild-type olive and
          speckled to leucistic, melanoid, albino, golden, and even GFP lines
          that fluoresce under UV.

          <h2>What are Salamanders and metamorphosis</h2>
          <p>
            Salamanders are amphibians that, like frogs and newts, start off
            living in the water. They usually go through metamorphosis to become
            adults like a tadpole transforming into a frog and then mostly live
            on land.
          </p>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              They replace water breathing <strong>gills</strong> with air
              breathing <strong>lungs</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              They grow <strong>eyelids</strong> and adapt their bodies for
              land.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 style="margin-top: 1.4rem">Why Axolotls are different...</h2>
          <p>
            Axolotls never make this transition. They keep their frilly external
            gills and other juvenile features and remain aquatic for their
            entire lifecycle this is called <strong>neoteny</strong> (or
            <strong>paedomorphism</strong>). Although axolotls look like the
            “tadpole” form of most salamanders, they do become adults in the
            sense that they can breed. They develop some lung tissue and can
            also breathe through their <strong>skin</strong>.
          </p>

          <h2 style="margin-top: 1.4rem">Close relatives?</h2>
          <p>
            Axolotls’ closest relatives are
            <strong>tiger salamanders</strong> (<em>Ambystoma tigrinum</em>). As
            a group, <em>Ambystoma</em> salamanders are called
            <em>mole salamanders</em> for the land dwelling adults’ habit of
            living underground.
